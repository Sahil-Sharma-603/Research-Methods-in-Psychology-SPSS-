# Statistical Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive statistical analysis of various behavioral and social datasets using **SPSS**. The analysis applies multiple statistical methods to test hypotheses and derive insights from real-world scenarios.  
Key methods include one-sample t-tests, dependent and independent t-tests, one-way ANOVA, factorial ANOVA, chi-square tests, and Mann-Whitney U tests. Each section covers hypothesis formulation, data analysis, SPSS output interpretation, and conclusions based on statistical significance.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into eight sections, each focusing on a specific statistical test applied to a unique dataset:

- **One-Sample T-Test:** Analyzed monthly grocery expenditures of 30 students to assess the impact of environmental factors (e.g., floods in British Columbia) on spending, comparing sample means against a hypothesized population mean.
- **Dependent Means T-Test:** Evaluated javelin throw distances for 30 students across two trials (with and without a 35-degree angle) to determine if the angle affects performance.
- **Independent Means T-Test:** Compared 1000-meter running times of 48 athletes using ordinary versus new whey protein powder to assess performance differences.
- **One-Way ANOVA:** Analyzed ratings of four science exhibition projects (water cycle, human body, genes, solar power) by 40 students to identify differences in perceived quality.
- **2x2 Factorial ANOVA:** Investigated the effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine across two dose levels (moderate and high) and two patient groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients) using blood test scores.
- **Chi-Square Test for Goodness of Fit:** Examined candy distribution preferences among 30 children across two years to test for differences in observed versus expected frequencies.
- **Chi-Square Test for Independence:** Explored the relationship between gender and preferred game type (outdoor vs. indoor) among 30 students.
- **Mann-Whitney U Test:** Compared annual salaries of 15 developers and 15 networkers to determine if there are significant differences in earnings.

## How to Use
1. **Dataset Preparation:** Each section includes raw data (e.g., grocery expenditures, javelin throw distances, etc.) that can be input into SPSS for analysis.  
2. **Running Analyses:** Use SPSS to perform the relevant statistical tests as outlined in each section. Ensure proper configuration for one-tailed or two-tailed tests based on hypotheses.  
3. **Interpreting Outputs:** Refer to the SPSS output explanations in each section to understand key metrics like t-scores, p-values, degrees of freedom, and confidence intervals.  
4. **Drawing Conclusions:** Compare p-values against the alpha level (Î± = 0.05) to accept or reject null hypotheses, as detailed in each section's conclusion.
